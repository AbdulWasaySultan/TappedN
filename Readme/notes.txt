firebase is used for user login/signup (authentication)
the name of the user and profile image is passed through useContext to the home screen 
//------------
used api context and redux both for state management (one is suffficient usually)
loginUser is the function that logs up in using the redux while login function logs in 
to the app using Context API which uses firebase builtin method to logsout

in redux we manually updates,resets,increase or decrease any state we want using local states
 with the redux while in context api we have used firebase builtin methods to login,logout,or 
 even we can use firestrore to update any state, the context api just holds the state which we 
 changes or will change!
